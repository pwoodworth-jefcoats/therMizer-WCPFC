# therMizer-WCPFC

This repository holds code for collaboration to run therMizer over the WCPFC domain.

Collaboration elements include:  
* incorporating spatial heteorogeneity and/or movement into therMizer,
* adding structural and parametricy uncertainty to simulations, and
* output probability estimates.

This ReadMe will be futher updated as the collaboration comes together.
